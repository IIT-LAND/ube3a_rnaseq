# Ube3a RNA-seq

This repository has all of the analysis code to accompany the RNA-seq analyses that go along with **Montani et al., Sex-biasing influence of autism-associated Ube3a over-expression at connectomics, behavioral and transcriptomic levels.**

Analysis code is contained in `analysis_final.Rmd`, `utils_final.R`, and `analysis_final.html`.
